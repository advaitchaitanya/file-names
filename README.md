# File Names
> Stay organised with a simple file naming convention

## Philosophy
A file naming convention helps you stay organised by making it easy to identify the information contained within a file. There is no perfect file naming convention. Filenames should be meaningful and consistent. And, it should be simple to follow.

## Rules
- Date the file created using the `yyyymmdd` format
- Use all lowercase letters
- Separate words using dashes
- If applicable, include a project name
- Append a version number if necessary (with leading zeroes)

## Examples
### `yyyymmdd-project-name-file-name`

```
├── brand-logo
│   ├── brand-logo-assets
│   │   ├── 20221115-brand-logo-inspiration-board.pdf
│   ├── 20220126-brand-logo-full-resolution.jpg
│   ├── 20220301-brand-logo-guidelines-02.txt
```

## Tips
- Store project related files in the same directory.
- The directory name indicates the project name and can follow the same rules. The date may be omitted.
- The filename begins with a date to organise files chronologically.
- Sometimes meaningful abbreviations are helpful to reduce the character size.
- Have fun and share your happiness!
